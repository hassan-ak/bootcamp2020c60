## AWS IAM Policies And Secret Manager Part 1

### Class Notes

IAM users is important for every service being used with AWS. Every thing in AWS revolves around roles and users. Every thing we need to access something it need some permissions. Working with permissions need to know about IAM. There are multiple options in IAM console. First is users which is a login for some user. Every user has some access type such as programmatic or console access. In the first case user can only intract using console and use different aws services while in console access a user can also use AWS web console. We can set permissions for a user or can add a user to a group.
We can also create custom policies where permissions for any sevice can be customized. When a servies is used to access an other service roles can be used there. And a particular role can have multiple permissions. This can be used to give access to some other AWS account holder.
